# Today I Learned

This is my Today I Learned microblog. It consists of short posts explaining what I learned that day. 

This is inspired by: 
- [Hashrocket's Today I Learned Blog](https://til.hashrocket.com/), 
- [Simon Willison's TIL which I forked from](https://github.com/simonw/til) who was inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) [and Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22908044).
